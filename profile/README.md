# ⭐ Welcome to Laminar VIP Space! ⭐

This org hosts a private repo that is available to people who are [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/raquo).

Nothing in that repo is essential to Laminar usage, but it might still be useful.

Aside from some code, the repo contains an invite link to a private `#vip-lounge` channel on Laminar Discord, and in the future I plan to post early releases of blog posts / learning materials /etc. there.

Thank you for supporting my open source work.

## Q: I don't see any repos here?

The [sponsorware repo](https://github.com/Laminar-VIP/sponsorware) should be visible to **current sponsors** [listed here](https://github.com/sponsors/raquo).

You might need to accept an invite that Github emailed to you on Feb 16 2023 (or when you became a sponsor, if you joined us after that).

However, if you used your Github **organization** instead of your personal account to sponsor me, Github does not automatically grant you access to sponsor repos. Please email me, and I will grant you access manually.
